# Google Hash 2020 Qualification Round

This repository contains my solutions to the qualification round of the Google Hash Code 2020 competition.
I did not actually take part. But screw it brev, solution only goes to the moon (#random_sort).

## Solutions

### Sort Books by score

This is the most basic solution. It sorts the books by their score and then assigns them to libraries in order.

### Random Sort

This is a solution that I came up with in the last 10 minutes of the competition. It is a very simple solution that just sorts the books randomly and assigns them to libraries in the order they are sorted. It is not a very good solution, but it is a solution nonetheless.
